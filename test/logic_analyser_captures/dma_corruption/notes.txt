Captured a 6000 byte DMA transfer which resulted in
bad data in the Spectrum. Trigger was on blipper1.

Matched up against a emulated Spectrum, the memory dump
of the real machine is different.

Byte 65 is 0xED, 237 decimal. That's the value transferred.
Emulator shows that.

In the real Spectrum byte 65 is 0x2B, 43 decimal.
(Second byte on line 8 of the photo.) Logic analyser
shows ED was on the bus.
